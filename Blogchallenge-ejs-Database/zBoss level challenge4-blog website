Step 1 - Save Composed Posts with MongoDB
Goal: You should be able to go to the compose page and add a new post which will be added to your database as a new document.

Verify by going into the mongo shell and find all posts.

/////
Step 2 - Get the Home Page to Render the Posts
Goal: When you go to localhost:3000 you should see the posts you created in the compose page.

/////
Step 3 - Fix the bug
At the moment, when you compose a post and redirect to the root/home route, sometimes the post is not yet saved and doesn’t show up on the home page.

Goal: Add a callback to the save method to only redirect to the home page once save is complete with no errors.

//////
Step 4 - Render the correct blog post based on post _id
Goal: When you click on Read More, it should take you to the post.ejs page rendering the correct post using the post._id
